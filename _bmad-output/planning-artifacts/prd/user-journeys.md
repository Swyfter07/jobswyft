# User Journeys

## Journey 1: The Active Job Hunter

**Persona: Marcus Chen**
- **Age**: 34
- **Situation**: Senior software engineer, just laid off in a tech downturn. Has 3 months of runway. Needs to send 10+ quality applications daily.
- **Goal**: Land interviews fast without burning out on repetitive application tasks
- **Obstacle**: Every application feels like starting from scratch. Copy-paste fatigue. Cover letters are a time sink.

**Opening Scene:**

It's 9 PM. Marcus has been job hunting for two weeks. His browser has 47 tabs open—LinkedIn, Indeed, company career pages. His eyes are glazed. He just spent 22 minutes on a single application for a role he's not even excited about. His cover letter was generic. He knows it. The company knows it. Another application into the void.

He thinks: *"There has to be a better way."*

A Reddit thread mentions Jobswyft. He installs it. Skeptical, but desperate.

**Rising Action:**

Marcus lands on a job posting at a Series B startup. He clicks the Jobswyft icon. A sidebar slides in—clean, unobtrusive. He signs in with Google. Uploads his resume.

The sidebar instantly recognizes the job page—no button click needed. Two seconds later, the job details appear: title, company, full description, even the salary range buried in paragraph six. *"How did it find that?"*

Below the job card, an instant match analysis appears: **87% match**. Green pills show his strengths: "Distributed Systems", "Team Leadership". Yellow pills flag gaps: "Kubernetes". Side-by-side layout. *"It already knows where I'm strong,"* he thinks.

He clicks **Cover Letter**. Selects "Confident" tone. Adds a custom note: "Mention my open-source contributions." Five seconds later, a cover letter appears. It sounds like him—but sharper. It highlights his system design work and connects it to the startup's scaling challenges.

He tweaks one sentence. Hits **Autofill**. The application form populates. Name, email, LinkedIn, resume uploaded, cover letter pasted. Fields highlight green.

**Climax:**

Marcus submits the application. He checks the time: 4 minutes. Not 22. *Four minutes.*

He grins. Opens the next tab. Auto-scan detects the job. Generates. Autofills. Submits. Tab after tab.

By 10:30 PM, he's submitted 12 high-quality applications. Each with a tailored cover letter. Each in under 5 minutes.

**Resolution:**

Three days later, Marcus has two interview requests—including the Series B startup. His applications stand out because they're personalized, not templated garbage.

He tells his laid-off coworker about Jobswyft. *"Dude, this thing paid for itself in the first hour."*

Marcus upgrades to Pro.

**Requirements Revealed:**
- Automatic job page detection and scanning (< 2 sec)
- Auto match analysis (instant, high-level) showing score, strengths, gaps as pills
- Cover letter generation with tone + custom instructions
- Autofill that handles standard fields reliably
- Speed optimized for high-volume appliers
- Clear value demonstration within first use

## Journey 2: The First-Time User

**Persona: Aisha Patel**
- **Age**: 28
- **Situation**: Marketing manager exploring new opportunities. Not desperate, but curious. Skeptical of "AI tools."
- **Goal**: See if this thing actually works before committing
- **Obstacle**: Trust. She's installed browser extensions before that were spammy, invasive, or useless.

**Opening Scene:**

Aisha sees a Jobswyft ad on LinkedIn. The promise sounds too good: *"Apply 5x faster."* She rolls her eyes. But she's been procrastinating on updating her applications, so she clicks.

Chrome Web Store. 4.8 stars. 50K users. *"Okay, not a scam."* She installs.

She's on a marketing manager posting at a DTC brand she likes. She clicks the extension icon. A sidebar appears.

**Rising Action:**

First thing she sees: **Sign in with Google**. No email/password. No friction. She clicks. Authenticated in 2 seconds.

Next: **Upload Resume**. She drags her PDF. A progress bar. *"Parsing..."* Done. Her resume appears in the tray at the top.

The sidebar instantly detects the job page and begins scanning automatically. A subtle progress indicator appears.

Within two seconds, the job details populate. Title: Marketing Manager. Company: GlowUp Beauty. Salary: $95K-$115K. Full job description. *"It just... knew?"*

Below the job card, an instant match analysis appears: **82% match**. Green pills: "Brand Campaigns", "DTC Experience". Yellow pills: "TikTok Marketing". Side-by-side layout. Clear, visual, instant feedback.

*"Okay... that's kind of impressive. And I do have TikTok experience—I should update my resume."*

She clicks **Cover Letter**. Chooses "Friendly" tone. The output is... actually good? It mentions GlowUp's recent product launch (pulled from the job description) and connects it to her DTC experience.

**Climax:**

Aisha realizes: *"This isn't replacing me. It's giving me a better first draft than I'd write at 11 PM."*

She edits two sentences to add her voice. Hits **Autofill**. The form fills. She scans the fields—all correct. She submits.

Total time: 6 minutes. Her first application in weeks.

**Resolution:**

Aisha doesn't upgrade yet—she's only used 1 of her 5 free generations. But she bookmarks three more jobs to apply to this weekend.

A week later, she's used all 5 free generations. She gets an interview at GlowUp. She upgrades to Starter.

*"Okay, I'm a believer."*

**Requirements Revealed:**
- Frictionless onboarding (Google OAuth, no forms)
- Clear UI with helpful tooltips for new users
- Immediate value demonstration on first scan (auto match included)
- Auto match analysis that surfaces actionable insights instantly
- Trust-building through transparency (no hidden actions)
- Free tier that's generous enough to prove value (20 auto matches/day)
- Upgrade path feels natural, not pushy

## Journey 3: The Returning User

**Persona: David Okonkwo**
- **Age**: 41
- **Situation**: Engineering director who used Jobswyft 6 months ago, landed a job, cancelled subscription. Now exploring again (new company is struggling).
- **Goal**: Pick up where he left off without re-learning everything
- **Obstacle**: Expects his data to be gone. Dreads re-uploading resumes and re-learning the UI.

**Opening Scene:**

David's company just announced a hiring freeze. Reading the room, he dusts off his job search. He remembers Jobswyft helped last time.

He clicks the extension icon. It's still installed. He's logged out.

He signs in with Google. Holds his breath.

**Rising Action:**

His dashboard loads. His 3 resumes are still there—including the executive resume he spent hours formatting. His active resume is still selected: *"David Okonkwo - Engineering Director 2025.pdf"*.

He exhales. *"Thank god."*

He navigates to the Jobs tab. His old saved jobs are there—marked as "Applied" or "Interviewed." A time capsule of his last search. He smiles seeing the job he landed (status: "Offer Accepted").

He opens a new job posting—VP of Engineering at a growth-stage startup. The sidebar auto-detects the page and scans instantly. Familiar. The UI hasn't changed much—maybe cleaner, but the muscle memory is there.

The instant match analysis appears: **92% match**. Green pills: "Team Scaling (20→100)", "M&A Integration", "Engineering Leadership". No yellow pills—he's a strong fit. The AI confidence is reassuring.

He clicks **Cover Letter**. Same flow. Tone: "Executive." Custom instruction: "Emphasize my M&A integration experience." The output is polished—boardroom-ready.

**Climax:**

David realizes: *"I'm not starting over. I'm continuing."*

He applies to 3 VP roles in 20 minutes. Each application is tailored. His confidence is back.

**Resolution:**

David resubscribes to Pro. He sets a goal: 5 strategic applications per week. Quality over quantity at his level.

Two weeks later, he's in final rounds at two companies.

He thinks: *"This is the only tool I actually keep coming back to."*

**Requirements Revealed:**
- Persistent data across sessions (resumes, saved jobs)
- Graceful re-authentication (no data loss on logout)
- Subscription pause/resume without data deletion
- Historical job tracking for returning users
- UI consistency across versions (muscle memory preserved)
- Premium tiers that serve senior/executive users

## Journey 4: The New Grad

**Persona: Jenna Morales**
- **Age**: 22
- **Situation**: Recent computer science graduate. First real job hunt. Has a decent resume but zero confidence in her cover letters.
- **Goal**: Land her first software engineering job without sounding like every other new grad
- **Obstacle**: Imposter syndrome. Doesn't know "how to sell herself." Cover letters feel fake and forced.

**Opening Scene:**

Jenna stares at a blank Google Doc. The cursor blinks. She's supposed to write a cover letter for a junior developer role at a fintech startup. She's written "Dear Hiring Manager" five times and deleted it five times.

Her resume lists her CS degree, two internships, and a capstone project. But she doesn't know how to *talk* about herself. Every sentence feels cringey or braggy or boring.

Her roommate—also job hunting—mentions Jobswyft. *"It writes cover letters that don't suck."*

Jenna installs it.

**Rising Action:**

She opens the job posting. Clicks the Jobswyft icon. Signs in. Uploads her resume (nervous—is it good enough?).

The sidebar recognizes the job page and scans automatically. The job details appear. Below, the instant match analysis loads: **78% match**.

Green pills: "Python", "Payment Systems Project", "Banking Internship". Yellow pills: "Production Kubernetes".

Jenna exhales. *"Okay, I actually do have relevant stuff."* The auto match saw things in her resume she'd undervalued. The visual layout makes it clear—she's closer than she thought.

She clicks **Cover Letter**. Pauses at tone selection. Chooses "Enthusiastic." Adds custom instruction: *"I'm a new grad—make it sound genuine, not desperate."*

The cover letter generates. She reads it:

> *"My capstone project—a peer-to-peer payment simulator—taught me that fintech isn't just about moving money; it's about building trust at scale. I'm excited to bring that perspective to [Company], where infrastructure reliability isn't a feature—it's the product."*

Jenna's jaw drops. *"I would never have written that. But it's... me?"*

**Climax:**

She edits one line to mention her professor's feedback on the capstone. Hits **Autofill**. Submits.

For the first time in her job search, she feels *confident* about an application.

**Resolution:**

Jenna applies to 8 more jobs that week. Each cover letter is different—tailored to the company, grounded in her experience. She stops dreading cover letters.

She gets 3 interview requests. More than most of her classmates.

At her first interview, the hiring manager says: *"Your cover letter stood out—it felt genuine."*

Jenna upgrades to Starter before her free generations run out. She tells her study group about Jobswyft.

*"It's like having a career coach that doesn't make you feel dumb."*

**Requirements Revealed:**
- Auto match analysis that builds confidence instantly (surface hidden strengths)
- Match score and visual pills (green/yellow) make feedback clear and encouraging
- Cover letter generation that sounds authentic, not corporate
- Tone options that serve different experience levels
- Custom instructions for personal touch
- UI that doesn't intimidate first-time job hunters
- Positive emotional reinforcement throughout experience
- Referral program to capture word-of-mouth from students
