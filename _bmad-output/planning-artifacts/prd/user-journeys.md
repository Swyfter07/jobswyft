# User Journeys

## Journey 1: The Active Job Hunter

**Persona: Marcus Chen**
- **Age**: 34
- **Situation**: Senior software engineer, just laid off in a tech downturn. Has 3 months of runway. Needs to send 10+ quality applications daily.
- **Goal**: Land interviews fast without burning out on repetitive application tasks
- **Obstacle**: Every application feels like starting from scratch. Copy-paste fatigue. Cover letters are a time sink.

**Opening Scene:**

It's 9 PM. Marcus has been job hunting for two weeks. His browser has 47 tabs open — LinkedIn, Indeed, company career pages. His eyes are glazed. He just spent 22 minutes on a single application for a role he's not even excited about. His cover letter was generic. He knows it. The company knows it. Another application into the void.

He thinks: *"There has to be a better way."*

A Reddit thread mentions Jobswyft. He installs it. Skeptical, but desperate.

**Rising Action:**

Marcus lands on a job posting at a Series B startup. He clicks the Jobswyft icon. A sidebar slides in — clean, unobtrusive. He signs in with Google. Uploads his resume.

The sidebar instantly recognizes the job page — no button click needed. Two seconds later, the Job Details Card appears: title, company, full description, even the salary range buried in paragraph six. *"How did it find that?"*

Below the job details, a quick match analysis loads: **87% match**. Green pills show his strengths: "Distributed Systems", "Team Leadership". Yellow pills flag gaps: "Kubernetes". Instant, visual, side-by-side.

The card has two buttons: **Deep Analysis** and **Ask Coach**. Marcus wants the full picture — he clicks **Deep Analysis**. The Match tool opens with a comprehensive breakdown: skill-by-skill alignment, experience gaps, suggested talking points, and a recommended strategy for this application. *"This is like having a recruiter who actually read my resume."*

He clicks **Cover Letter**. Selects "Confident" tone. Adds a custom note: "Mention my open-source contributions." Five seconds later, a cover letter appears. It sounds like him — but sharper. It highlights his system design work and connects it to the startup's scaling challenges.

He tweaks one sentence. Hits **Autofill**. The application form populates. Name, email, LinkedIn, resume uploaded, cover letter pasted. Fields highlight green.

**Climax:**

Marcus submits the application. He checks the time: 4 minutes. Not 22. *Four minutes.*

He grins. Opens the next tab. Auto-scan detects the job. Quick match loads. He glances at the score — 72%. Skips Deep Analysis this time, goes straight to Cover Letter. Generates. Autofills. Submits. Tab after tab.

By 10:30 PM, he's submitted 12 high-quality applications. Each with a tailored cover letter. Each in under 5 minutes.

**Resolution:**

Three days later, Marcus has two interview requests — including the Series B startup. His applications stand out because they're personalized, not templated garbage.

He tells his laid-off coworker about Jobswyft. *"Dude, this thing paid for itself in the first hour."*

Marcus upgrades to Pro.

**Requirements Revealed:**
- Automatic job page detection and scanning (<2 sec)
- Job Details Card with quick match analysis (score, strengths/gaps as pills)
- Two action buttons: Deep Analysis → Match tool, Ask Coach → Coach
- Deep Analysis provides comprehensive skill-by-skill breakdown
- Cover letter generation with tone + custom instructions
- Autofill that handles standard fields reliably
- Speed optimized for high-volume appliers (skip deep analysis when speed matters)
- Clear value demonstration within first use

## Journey 2: The First-Time User

**Persona: Aisha Patel**
- **Age**: 28
- **Situation**: Marketing manager exploring new opportunities. Not desperate, but curious. Skeptical of "AI tools."
- **Goal**: See if this thing actually works before committing
- **Obstacle**: Trust. She's installed browser extensions before that were spammy, invasive, or useless.

**Opening Scene:**

Aisha sees a Jobswyft ad on LinkedIn. The promise sounds too good: *"Apply 5x faster."* She rolls her eyes. But she's been procrastinating on updating her applications, so she clicks.

Chrome Web Store. 4.8 stars. 50K users. *"Okay, not a scam."* She installs.

She's on a marketing manager posting at a DTC brand she likes. She clicks the extension icon. A sidebar appears.

**Rising Action:**

First thing she sees: **Sign in with Google**. No email/password. No friction. She clicks. Authenticated in 2 seconds.

Next: **Upload Resume**. She drags her PDF. A progress bar. *"Parsing..."* Done. Her resume appears in the tray at the top.

The sidebar instantly detects the job page and begins scanning automatically. A subtle progress indicator appears.

Within two seconds, the Job Details Card populates. Title: Marketing Manager. Company: GlowUp Beauty. Salary: $95K-$115K. Full job description.

Below, the quick match analysis loads: **82% match**. Green pills: "Brand Campaigns", "DTC Experience". Yellow pills: "TikTok Marketing".

*"Okay... that's kind of impressive. And I do have TikTok experience — I should update my resume."*

She sees the **Deep Analysis** and **Ask Coach** buttons on the card but skips them — the quick match gave her enough signal. She clicks **Cover Letter**. Chooses "Friendly" tone. The output is... actually good? It mentions GlowUp's recent product launch (pulled from the job description) and connects it to her DTC experience.

**Climax:**

Aisha realizes: *"This isn't replacing me. It's giving me a better first draft than I'd write at 11 PM."*

She edits two sentences to add her voice. Hits **Autofill**. The form fills. She scans the fields — all correct. She submits.

Total time: 6 minutes. Her first application in weeks.

**Resolution:**

Aisha doesn't upgrade yet — she's only used 1 of her 5 free generations. But she bookmarks three more jobs to apply to this weekend.

A week later, she's used all 5 free generations. She gets an interview at GlowUp. She upgrades to Starter.

*"Okay, I'm a believer."*

**Requirements Revealed:**
- Frictionless onboarding (Google OAuth, no forms)
- Clear UI with helpful tooltips for new users
- Immediate value demonstration on first scan (quick match included)
- Job Details Card with quick match as sufficient signal for casual users
- Trust-building through transparency (no hidden actions)
- Free tier that's generous enough to prove value
- Upgrade path feels natural, not pushy

## Journey 3: The Returning User

**Persona: David Okonkwo**
- **Age**: 41
- **Situation**: Engineering director who used Jobswyft 6 months ago, landed a job, cancelled subscription. Now exploring again (new company is struggling).
- **Goal**: Pick up where he left off without re-learning everything
- **Obstacle**: Expects his data to be gone. Dreads re-uploading resumes and re-learning the UI.

**Opening Scene:**

David's company just announced a hiring freeze. Reading the room, he dusts off his job search. He remembers Jobswyft helped last time.

He clicks the extension icon. It's still installed. He's logged out.

He signs in with Google. Holds his breath.

**Rising Action:**

His dashboard loads. His 3 resumes are still there — including the executive resume he spent hours formatting. His active resume is still selected: *"David Okonkwo - Engineering Director 2025.pdf"*.

He exhales. *"Thank god."*

He navigates to the Jobs tab. His old saved jobs are there — marked as "Applied" or "Interviewed." A time capsule of his last search. He smiles seeing the job he landed (status: "Offer Accepted").

He opens a new job posting — VP of Engineering at a growth-stage startup. The sidebar auto-detects the page and scans instantly. Familiar. The Job Details Card appears with the quick match: **92% match**. Green pills: "Team Scaling (20→100)", "M&A Integration", "Engineering Leadership". No yellow pills — he's a strong fit.

At his level, David always wants the full picture. He clicks **Deep Analysis**. The Match tool delivers a comprehensive breakdown — his M&A integration experience is rare and highly relevant. The analysis recommends leading with it. *"That's exactly right,"* he thinks.

He clicks **Cover Letter**. Tone: "Executive." Custom instruction: "Emphasize my M&A integration experience." The output is polished — boardroom-ready.

**Climax:**

David realizes: *"I'm not starting over. I'm continuing."*

He applies to 3 VP roles in 20 minutes. Each application is tailored. His confidence is back.

**Resolution:**

David resubscribes to Pro. He sets a goal: 5 strategic applications per week. Quality over quantity at his level.

Two weeks later, he's in final rounds at two companies.

He thinks: *"This is the only tool I actually keep coming back to."*

**Requirements Revealed:**
- Persistent data across sessions (resumes, saved jobs)
- Graceful re-authentication (no data loss on logout)
- Subscription pause/resume without data deletion
- Historical job tracking for returning users
- Deep Analysis as default path for senior/executive users
- UI consistency across versions (muscle memory preserved)
- Premium tiers that serve senior/executive users

## Journey 4: The New Grad

**Persona: Jenna Morales**
- **Age**: 22
- **Situation**: Recent computer science graduate. First real job hunt. Has a decent resume but zero confidence in her cover letters.
- **Goal**: Land her first software engineering job without sounding like every other new grad
- **Obstacle**: Imposter syndrome. Doesn't know "how to sell herself." Cover letters feel fake and forced.

**Opening Scene:**

Jenna stares at a blank Google Doc. The cursor blinks. She's supposed to write a cover letter for a junior developer role at a fintech startup. She's written "Dear Hiring Manager" five times and deleted it five times.

Her resume lists her CS degree, two internships, and a capstone project. But she doesn't know how to *talk* about herself. Every sentence feels cringey or braggy or boring.

Her roommate — also job hunting — mentions Jobswyft. *"It writes cover letters that don't suck."*

Jenna installs it.

**Rising Action:**

She opens the job posting. Clicks the Jobswyft icon. Signs in. Uploads her resume (nervous — is it good enough?).

The sidebar recognizes the job page and scans automatically. The Job Details Card appears. Below, the quick match analysis loads: **78% match**.

Green pills: "Python", "Payment Systems Project", "Banking Internship". Yellow pills: "Production Kubernetes".

Jenna exhales. *"Okay, I actually do have relevant stuff."* The quick match saw things in her resume she'd undervalued.

She sees the two buttons on the card. She doesn't feel ready to generate anything yet — she wants guidance first. She clicks **Ask Coach**.

The AI Studio opens to the Coach sub-tab with a chat interface and skill suggestions: "Interview Prep", "Application Strategy", "Company Insights". She types: *"Is this job a good fit for me? I'm a new grad and the Kubernetes requirement scares me."*

The Coach responds — it knows her resume and the job:

> *"You're a stronger fit than you think. Your payment systems capstone directly aligns with their fintech focus. The Kubernetes requirement is listed as 'nice to have' in the description — your Docker experience from your internship is the foundation they're looking for. I'd recommend applying and leading with your fintech project experience."*

*"Okay, I'm doing this."*

She clicks **Cover Letter**. Chooses "Enthusiastic." Adds: *"I'm a new grad — make it sound genuine, not desperate."*

The cover letter generates. She reads it:

> *"My capstone project — a peer-to-peer payment simulator — taught me that fintech isn't just about moving money; it's about building trust at scale. I'm excited to bring that perspective to [Company], where infrastructure reliability isn't a feature — it's the product."*

Jenna's jaw drops. *"I would never have written that. But it's... me?"*

**Climax:**

She edits one line to mention her professor's feedback on the capstone. Hits **Autofill**. Submits.

For the first time in her job search, she feels *confident* about an application.

**Resolution:**

Jenna applies to 8 more jobs that week. Each cover letter is different — tailored to the company, grounded in her experience. She stops dreading cover letters.

She gets 3 interview requests. More than most of her classmates.

At her first interview, the hiring manager says: *"Your cover letter stood out — it felt genuine."*

Jenna upgrades to Starter before her free generations run out. She tells her study group about Jobswyft.

*"It's like having a career coach that doesn't make you feel dumb."*

**Requirements Revealed:**
- Quick match analysis that builds confidence (surface hidden strengths)
- Ask Coach button on Job Details Card for guidance-seekers
- Coach with context awareness (knows resume + job)
- Match score and visual pills (green/yellow) make feedback clear and encouraging
- Cover letter generation that sounds authentic, not corporate
- Tone options that serve different experience levels
- Custom instructions for personal touch
- UI that doesn't intimidate first-time job hunters
- Positive emotional reinforcement throughout experience

## Journey 5: The Platform Admin

**Persona: Priya Sharma**
- **Age**: 29
- **Situation**: Jobswyft's first operations lead. Wears many hats — product ops, support triage, config management. Reports directly to the founder.
- **Goal**: Keep the platform running smoothly, make data-driven decisions, and respond to user issues fast
- **Obstacle**: Scaling a new product with limited team. Needs visibility without engineering bottlenecks.

**Opening Scene:**

It's launch week. Priya's Slack is buzzing. 2,000 installs in the first 48 hours after the Product Hunt launch. She opens the Admin Dashboard.

The usage analytics panel shows a spike — scans are up 400%, AI generations climbing. She smiles. But then she notices: feedback reports are trickling in. Three users flagged "extraction not working" on Workday career pages.

**Rising Action:**

Priya clicks into the Feedback Review section. She sees the reports — all from Workday URLs, all flagging partial scan results. She tags them as "extraction-issue" and notes the pattern. She'll escalate to engineering with the specific URLs and error context.

She switches to User Management. Scrolls through the new signups. Mostly free tier. Conversion to paid is at 0% — expected, since paid tiers aren't active yet. But she wants to see engagement: how many users completed their first scan? How many generated a cover letter?

The usage analytics show: 68% of users who installed also scanned a job. 42% generated at least one AI output. Good top-of-funnel engagement.

Next, she opens Tier Configuration. The founder wants to test a more generous free tier — bump from 5 lifetime generations to 15 for launch week as a promotion. Priya updates the value in the config panel. She confirms the change. Within minutes, the extension and API pick up the new limit.

**Climax:**

A user emails support: *"I love this tool but I ran out of free credits in 10 minutes. Any way to get more?"* Priya checks their usage — 5 generations, all cover letters, all within 12 minutes of install. A power user on day one.

She realizes the free tier is too tight for users who "get it" immediately. She recommends to the founder: keep the 15-generation launch promotion permanent for the free tier. The data backs it up — users who hit the limit fast are the most likely to convert.

**Resolution:**

By end of launch week, Priya has: tagged 12 extraction issues by job board, adjusted the free tier config twice, identified the top 3 feedback themes, and compiled a weekly ops report from the admin dashboard — all without a single engineering ticket for config changes.

She thinks: *"I can actually run this without bothering the devs every time."*

**Requirements Revealed:**
- Admin dashboard with role-based access (Supabase admin roles)
- Feedback review and tagging system
- Usage analytics (installs, scans, generations, conversion funnel)
- Tier configuration management (edit limits, names, pricing — live propagation)
- User management overview (signups, tier distribution, engagement)
- Config changes propagate to extension + API without deploys

## Journey 6: The Coach Seeker — Interview Prep

**Persona: Jenna Morales (returning from Journey 4)**
- **Situation**: Two weeks later. Jenna got an interview at the fintech startup. She's thrilled — and terrified. She's never done a technical behavioral interview.
- **Goal**: Prepare for her interview using the Coach tool
- **Obstacle**: She doesn't know what questions to expect or how to structure her answers.

**Opening Scene:**

Jenna opens the job posting again — the fintech role she applied to. She wants to review the job description before her interview tomorrow. She clicks the Jobswyft icon.

The sidebar opens. The job is still detected — the Job Details Card appears with her previous quick match: **78% match**. Green pills: "Python", "Payment Systems Project". Yellow pill: "Production Kubernetes".

She clicks **Ask Coach**.

**Rising Action:**

The AI Studio opens to the Coach sub-tab. She sees a clean chat interface with skill suggestions: "Interview Prep", "Salary Research", "Company Insights", "General Advice". She taps **Interview Prep**.

The Coach responds with context-aware guidance — it already knows the job (fintech, junior dev, Kubernetes mentioned) and her resume (CS degree, payment systems capstone, two internships):

> *"For a junior developer interview at a fintech startup, expect a mix of technical and behavioral questions. Given your background, they'll likely ask about your payment systems project and how you handle ambiguity. Let's practice. Ready for a mock question?"*

Jenna types: *"Yes, hit me."*

> *"Tell me about a time you had to learn a new technology quickly to complete a project."*

Jenna drafts an answer about learning Docker for her capstone. The Coach gives feedback:

> *"Strong start. Try the STAR format: add a specific metric for your Result. How much did containerization improve your deployment time?"*

She rewrites. Better.

She asks: *"What about the Kubernetes gap? They'll probably ask about it."*

> *"Great awareness. Frame it honestly: you haven't used production K8s, but your Docker experience is the foundation. Mention you've explored minikube on your own. Interviewers at this level value learning ability over checklist experience."*

**Climax:**

Jenna realizes: *"I'm not just applying anymore — I'm preparing. This thing knows my resume AND the job."*

She spends 30 minutes with the Coach. By the end, she has practiced answers for 5 likely questions, has a strategy for the Kubernetes gap, and knows what to research about the company's tech stack.

**Resolution:**

The next day, Jenna walks into the interview calm. When they ask about learning new technologies, she nails the STAR format. When Kubernetes comes up, she's ready with the framing the Coach suggested.

She gets the offer.

She texts her roommate: *"The Coach feature is insane. It's like having a career advisor who actually read my resume."*

**Requirements Revealed:**
- Coach/Chat tool with job + resume context awareness
- Skills UI with selectable topics (Interview Prep, Salary, Company Insights, etc.)
- Free-form chat for follow-up questions
- Multi-turn conversation with memory within session
- Context-aware responses (knows scanned job details + active resume)
- Job Details Card → Ask Coach button navigation flow
