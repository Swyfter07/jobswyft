# Epic API: Backend API Enhancements — Story Details

> **Living backlog.** Stories are added here as Epic EXT development discovers backend gaps.
> Each story references the originating EXT story and tech debt ID.
> Stories can be implemented in parallel with EXT — frontend mocks the API, backend builds the real endpoint, integration verified when both sides ship.
